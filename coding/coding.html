    <h2 style="color: blue;">Language teaches children how to communicate and teaches logical thinking. Language also strengthens both verbal and and written skills.  Children should be exposed to different languages at an early age. It helps them to understand the world around them better. Coding has a language all its own.  Every letter in the Alphabet has a special formula of 0’s and 1’s that represent it. These 0’s and 1’s give the technology around us directions on how to perform.  What better way for our children to understand why and how the technology around them operates than by learning to code and speaking to the technology around them.

    <h2 style="color: blue;">By experimenting, children learn and strengthen their brains. Even when they make a mistake they learn. Children can be creative and creativity is encouraged. Creativity is part of the process and not always the product.

    <h2 style="color: blue;">Coding helps children to be able to  visualize abstract concepts, lets them apply math to real-world situations, and makes math fun and creative.  Coding is present in many of today’s STEM programs.

    <h2 style="color: blue;">Children who learn to code understand how to plan and organize thoughts.  This can lead to better writing skills that can be built upon as coding skills develop over time.</h2>

    <h2 style="color: blue;">As they learn to code and give direction they learn that there is no one way to do something and that even if their way didn’t work.  They can improve upon what they have already done without worrying about failing. Coding is a basic literacy in the digital age, and it is important for kids to understand and be able to work with and understand the technology around them.</h2>

    <h2 style="color: blue;"> Having children learn coding at a young age prepares them for the future.  Coding helps children with communication, creativity, math,writing, and confidence.</h2>
