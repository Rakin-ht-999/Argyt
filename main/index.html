            <h1>Some Good advices from Me</h1>
            <h3>1. Take time to know yourself. "Know thyself". When you know who you are, you can be wise about your goals, your dreams, your standards, your convictions. Knowing who you are allows you to live your life with purpose and meaning.</h3>
            <h3>2. Be patient and persistent. Life is not so much what you accomplish as what you overcome. </h3>
            <h3>3. Luck comes from hard work. Luck happens when hard work and timing and talent intersect.</h3>
            <h3>4. Be your best at all times. You never know what the future will bring, so always make the best use of the present.</h3>
            <h3>5. Don't try to impress everyone. The unhappiest people are those who care the most about what other people think.</h3>
            <h3>6. Don't make decisions when you are angry or ecstatic. The best decisions are made with a clear conscious mind, not in the throes of any emotion--positive or negative.</h3>

                <h1>Why we need Coding?</h1>
                <p>Language teaches children how to communicate and teaches logical thinking. Language also strengthens both verbal and and written skills. Children should be exposed to different languages at an early age. It helps them to understand the world around them better. Coding has a language all its own. Every letter in the Alphabet has a special formula of 0’s and 1’s that represent it. These 0’s and 1’s give the technology around us directions on how to perform. What better way for our children to understand why and how the technology around them operates than by learning

            <div class="service-item"><h1>Covid-19</h1>
                <p>Coronaviruses are a large family of respiratory viruses that can cause illness in people and animals. In rare cases, coronaviruses that circulate among animals can evolve and infect humans. In turn, these infections can easily spread from person-to-person as was the case with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) and Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV).
                    An outbreak of the novel (new) coronavirus was first reported in December 2019 when cases of viral pneumonia with unknown origin were confirmed in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.

                    <h1> Bangladesh</h1>
                    <p>The name of our country is the People's Republic of Bangladesh. It is one of the most beautiful countries in the world. Our country was a part of Pakistan before 1971. Then we freed our country and achieved victory after nine month's liberation war. 3 million people sacrificed their lives in the liberation war in 1971. Our independence day is 26th March and Victory day is 16th December. The national language of our country is Bangla.
